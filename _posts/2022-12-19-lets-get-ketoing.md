Its been a year. A year of ups and downs. A year of sunshine, ocean dips and reveling in the glory of Cape Town. I went through a breakup, I moved house, I went to Hamburg, Germany and I injured my back. 2022 has been a year of new friends, learning, patience and continually forgiving and being kind to myself. And what a year its been! 

One major thing thats gotten me through all of this is knowing that I have a keto lifestyle to keep me going. The food I eat is not bland or restrictive. Its not dry or plain and portions are not miniscule. Keto allows me to really fuel my body, with goodness and nutrients and all the things that allow me to enjoy the world for what it is. I eat fat and protein and real foods filled with goodness. 

Keto has also been an interesting experiment for me, where I get to use my creative side to whip up keto alternatives to things that would traditionally not be so healthy for one. Keto cooking is fun, and delicious, and makes my body feel so much happier and more alive than any other way of eating ever has. Did I mention its delicious?

So what I'm planning on doing is using this platform to share some of my creations. With recipes and tips and how I think they went. For me, as a recipe book and record - things I like to eat in different categories. And perhaps for others, if I choose to share this link with anyone ever :)
