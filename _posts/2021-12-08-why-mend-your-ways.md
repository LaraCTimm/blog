You may be thinking - who really starts a blog in 2021? Blogs are so 2009!

Hi, I'm Lara Timm, and I'm starting a blog in 2021! Nice to meet you :) 

This is definitely not the first blog of its kind, nor will it be the last. This blog is intended to be a way for me keep track of my thoughts, experiences, learnings and creations. It aims to be the esssence of what makes me, me. A scrapbook of sorts, a jumbled collection of things that I learn on my journey to becoming the kind of person that I think I want to be. 

So why *Mend Your Ways*? First of all, comitting to a name for this blog was tricky. Maybe it will still change in time. However, somehow *Mend Your Ways* just feels right. Part of my journey is learning to trust my gut, learning to accept that things may not be perfect and learning to be okay with changing my mind. Hence - Mend your Ways it is.

*Mend Your Ways* is an English idiom meaning to "improve one's habits or behavoiur" or "to start behaving in a different, usually preferrable way". 

I see *Mend Your Ways* as an opportunity for me to document how I heal the unhealthy habits and crappy default behavours of the past - so that life is just better for me and those around me.

You are invited to join me on this journey. Welcome to my irregular, text based, averagely researched TED talk.

Keep growing,\
Lara
